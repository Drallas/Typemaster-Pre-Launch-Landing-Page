## Overview

This is the first project where i'm using sass css preprocessor, i'm sure it could have been done (a bit) more efficient. I'm still learning and happy with the result so far. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / SASS / BEM

### What I learned

- Preparing the build and drawing up a small plan of attack is very helpful building a frondend design.
- Starting with the mobile and making sure it's good; before continuing with the other layouts is an efficient workflow.
- SASS is usefull but it requires some time to get used to it and even more to utilise most of the features. 

### Continued development

My development is best served by building more projects like this, collect feedback and refine. For now i want to improve CSS / BEM / SASS and make sure that i keep on learning this craft. My focus areas are responsive layout and avoiding too much exact element properties.
